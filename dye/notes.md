# Notes

Rit Dye recommends using 3 gallons (11 L) of water for roughly every pound 1 pound (454g) of fabric youâ€™re coloring.

For best results, use approximately half a bottle of liquid dye per pound (454g) of fabric

1 bottle is 236 ml.

They recommend 1 cup of salt per 1 gallon of water.

## Calculations

// water
11 l for 454 g of fabric
11000 ml - 454 g
x ml - 1 g
11000 = 454x
11000 / 454 = x
x = 24.2 ml per 1 gram

// dye
118 = 454x
118/454 = x
x = 0.26 ml per 1 gram

// salt
250 ml - 3785 ml
1 ml - 15.1 ml
0.06 ml - 1 ml
0.06 * 24.2 - 1 gram
1.452 ml = 1 g
